To install gsample, you need to first download/compile two software packages, 
Samtools and Boost, setup the corresponding environmental variables, and then
compile the source code of gsample.

1, Download Samtools from {http://www.htslib.org/} with version 1.2 or higher.
Compile it to generate the htslib file libhts.a. Set environment variable
HTSLIB to indicate the directory of libhts.a.  For example, for Unix platforms,
add the following statement to the file ~/.bash_profile:

	export HTSLIB="/directory/to/your/htslib/htslib-1.2.1"

2, Download Boost from {http://www.boost.org}. Uncompress it
somewhere~(compiling and installing are not necessary). Set environment
variable BOOST_HOME to indicate the directory of Boost.  For example, for Unix
platforms, add the following statement to the file ~/.bash_profile:

	export BOOST_HOME="/directory/to/your/boost/boost_1_60_0"

3, Execute the following commands to generate Makefile and compile:\\

	aclocal
	autoconf
	autoheader
	automake -a
	./configure
	make

The executable file gsamples will be present at src.

4, COMMAND LINE
The usage of gsamples is: ./gsamples <in-bam-file> <out-sample-file> [-f fasta-dir] [-g gtf-file] [-e min-expression]
 The parameter <in-bam-file> specifies the input reads alignemnt file. It has to be sorted (for example, by samtools).
 The parameter <out-sample-file> specifies the the output sample file.
 The parameter [fasta-dir] is optional but strongly recommended, which specifies directory of all sequences files of all chromosomes. 
 These sequence files will be used as features.
 The parameter [gtf-file] is optional, which specifies the ground-truth expressed transcripts. If this file is given, the true boundaries
 will be contained in the output sample file as true labels; otherwise, the true labels will be -1. When evaluting mode is on (i.e., to
 evalute the performance of this method, this file should be given.
 The parameter [min-expression] is together with [-g gtf-file], which will make gsamples ignore these transcripts in the gtf-file with
 expression abundance under this value.
