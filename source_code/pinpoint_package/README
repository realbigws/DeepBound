	make

 The executable file pinpoint will be present at src.

2, COMMAND LINE
 The usage of pinpoint is: ./pinpoint: <sample-file> <prediction-file> <output-file> [-p probability-threshold] [-w window-size]
 The parameter <sample-file> specifies the sample file used for prediction (see gsamples program).
 The parameter <prediction-file> specifies the probability file generated by the DeepBound.
 The parameter <output-file> specifies the predicted boundaries: 0 for end-boundary, 1 for non-boundary, and 2 for start-boundary.
 The parameter [probability-threshold] is optional (default value is 0.60), which specifies the minimum average probability over a window that will be considerred as a true boundary.
 The parameter [window-size] is optional (default value is 10), which gives the window size.
